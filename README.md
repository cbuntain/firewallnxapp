# Simple Network Analysis Script

This Python script reads in a set of firewall logs that describe connections between IP addresses. These connections are converted into a directed graph, and the script runs a few simple analytics on the resulting graph.

## Running

Run the following: 

    python3 fwlog1.csv [fwlog2.csv ...]
